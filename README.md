Welcome to Selam's Super Sandwiches! This project creates an online shop to order Sandwiches from the Deli, goes to checkout, and prints out a receipt with the items selected.

Here is the Main Menu where the user is given the options of creating a sandwich, ordering a drink or chips, choosing a signature sandwich, or to exit the program entirely

When the user chooses sandwich, they are prompted with the options of how they would like to customize their sandwich.
As you can see the user can request for no meat or for no cheese as well

I saved the toppings in an arraylist so that the user can choose multiple different topping options, or choose none at all

When the user completes their order for a sandwich, they are given all the toppings they have added, and are the price of the sandwich

Once the user finishes their sandwich, it goes back to the main menu
Here you can see the Drink and chip menu. It works similarly to the sandwich menu, as the user is presented with the drinks and drink sizes, as well as the different chips

When the user selected checkout, they are presented with the different items they added to their bag. The sum is totaled, and and the user is prompted to checkout

When the user checks out, they are printed a receipt with a random number to print a new receipt every time.

When the user selects a signature sandwich, they have a preset on the ingredients that they have along with the price. It then gets added to their checkout.

I chose this as my interesting piece of code because it took me a while to get through since I added a feature to not include meat or cheese, so I had to calculate that in my getTotal method.
